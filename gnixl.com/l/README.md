# links
This is a directory for short urls, e.g.: `gnixl.com/l/abc`, pointing to
longer URLs like `http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/` (which
at the time of this writing is no longer valid, but that's immaterial).

The idea in this example case is to make subdirectory `abc` with an index.html
file, or .htaccess file, which redirects to the desired URL.

The need for this came about when finding long URLs in documents being used
for the noosepapers project, which broke the script. But I've also, at times,
wished I had an URL shortener for other things as well.
