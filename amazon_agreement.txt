To comply with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulations, your link level disclosure must be:

1. Clear. A clear disclosure could be as simple as “(paid link)”, “#ad” or “#CommissionsEarned”.
2. Conspicuous. The disclosure should be unavoidable and easily understandable by your audience. It should be placed near any affiliate link or product review in a location that customers will notice easily. They shouldn’t have to hunt for it in a comment section or in a biography section of your profile page.

In addition, the Operating Agreement requires that the following statement clearly and conspicuously appears on your Site: “As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.” For social media user-generated content, this statement must be associated with your account.
