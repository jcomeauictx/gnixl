<h1>Parabellum Life</h1>

The Parabellum life is one of constant readiness for battle. It is for those
who have seen the historical tendency of strong men creating a better world
for their children, only to watch their children and grandchildren destroy it.
We reject the idea that there should be generations of poets, painters, and
philosophers with no grounding in the art of defense. Every man should be as
comfortable with his rifle as he is with his books.
<p>
If you resolve to prepare yourself likewise: you are Parabellum. Welcome.
