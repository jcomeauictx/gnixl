All Night Coffee coming soon! <!-- Hey Twitter, this account belongs to
jc@unternet.net (@jcomeau_ictx) -->
</p>
<p>
The first incarnation of AllNightCoffee will likely be in Petaluma, where I'll
take advantage of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB946">SB 946</a> to serve coffee from dusk until
the downtown Starbucks opens at 0430 each morning, right outside their shop
on Putnam Plaza.
